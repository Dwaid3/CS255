Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The client was driverpass and they wanted the system to help new drivers with the drivers license testing.


What did you do particularly well?
  I think I did well at organizing the diagrams to where it was very informational. They we standardized and easy to follow along.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would be more informational. I believe that I did not explain in depth many things which could lead to confusion. For example I just said things like,
  for security we will use a cloud based server.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I interpreted the users needs by ensure that the idea they had in mind was put into a plan of action. The system I came up with will allow users to do exactly what 
  they imagined. Ensuring they have everything they need makes it easy for them, and will allow them to focus on running the buisness succesfully.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I think the agile methodology is a great way to approach designing software and I would like to continue using those values. The techniques that are very important is 
  all of the different UML designs throughout class. These graphs are so important to breaking the prorgam and process down.
